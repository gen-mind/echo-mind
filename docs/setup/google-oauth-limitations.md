## Critical Limitations

### 1. No Wildcard Subdomain Support ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Issue:**
Google OAuth **does not support wildcard subdomains** in authorized redirect URIs. You cannot use `https://*.echomind.ch/api/v1/google/auth/callback`.

**Impact:**
- **Manual setup required** for each customer subdomain
- **Time cost:** 5 minutes per new customer deployment
- **Risk:** Forgetting to add a subdomain breaks OAuth for that customer

**Evidence:**
- [Google OAuth2 Developers Group Discussion](https://groups.google.com/g/oauth2-dev/c/x7OPvf2xL0Q) (confirmed 2018, still valid 2026)
- Quote: "Redirect URIs must be an exact match. Wildcards are not supported for security reasons."

**Workaround:**
- Maintain list of customer subdomains in internal documentation
- Add new subdomain to Google Cloud Console when deploying for new customer
- See: [Adding New Customer Subdomains](./google-oauth-setup.md#adding-new-customer-subdomains)

**V2 Solution:**
Customer-managed OAuth apps (V2.3) allow customers to use their own domain, eliminating EchoMind admin involvement.

### 2. Per-User Authorization Required

**Issue:**
Each EchoMind user must individually authorize Google access. There is no "organization-wide" authorization in V1.

**Impact:**
- **Onboarding friction:** New users must click "Connect to Google" before using connectors
- **Higher OAuth volume:** More OAuth requests = higher risk of hitting rate limits
- **No shared resource access:** Users can only access their personal Google data (not org-wide Shared Drives)

**Example Scenario:**
- Company has 100 employees using EchoMind
- All 100 must individually connect their Google Drive
- If 10 users forget, their Drive data won't be indexed

**Workaround:**
- Provide clear onboarding instructions emphasizing Google connection
- Send reminder emails to users who haven't connected after 7 days
- Dashboard widget showing "Connect Google to unlock Drive search"

**V2 Solution:**
Service Account support (V2.1) enables admin to authorize once for entire organization.

---

### 3. Read-Only Access Only

**Issue:**
V1 uses **read-only scopes** (`drive.readonly`, `gmail.readonly`, etc.). Users cannot perform write operations from EchoMind.

**Impact:**
- Cannot create Drive documents
- Cannot send Gmail messages
- Cannot create Calendar events
- Cannot add Contacts

**Why Read-Only:**
- **Security:** Reduces attack surface (compromised EchoMind = data leak, not data modification)
- **Scope creep prevention:** Prevents feature requests like "Send email from EchoMind"
- **Trust:** Users more comfortable granting read access vs. write access

**Workaround:**
None (this is intentional design). If write access needed, request in V2.

**V2 Solution:**
Carefully scope write permissions per feature (e.g., `gmail.send` only if email integration feature enabled).

---

## Operational Limitations

### 4. No Automated Quota Monitoring

**Issue:**
Google APIs have daily quota limits (default: 10,000 requests/day per API). V1 has **no automated monitoring** of quota usage.

**Impact:**
- **Risk of hitting limits unexpectedly** during high-usage periods
- **No alerting** when approaching quota limit
- **Manual checking required** via Google Cloud Console

**Current Monitoring Process:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard"
3. Select API (e.g., Google Drive API)
4. Click "Quotas" tab
5. Manually check usage percentage

**Workaround:**
- Set weekly calendar reminder to check quota usage
- Reduce connector sync frequency if usage is high (e.g., 120 min instead of 60 min)
- Request quota increase from Google if consistently hitting limits

**V2 Solution:**
Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboard + auto-throttling (V2.2).

### 5. Token Refresh Edge Cases

**Issue:**
Google refresh tokens can become invalid in certain edge cases:

1. **User changed password:** Refresh token immediately invalidated
2. **User revoked access:** Token invalidated (expected)
3. **6 months of inactivity:** Google auto-revokes unused refresh tokens
4. **Maximum refresh tokens reached:** Google allows 50 refresh tokens per user per OAuth client. Oldest token auto-revoked when limit exceeded.

**Impact:**
- Connector sync fails silently
- User sees "Authorization failed" error when manually triggering sync
- User must re-authorize to fix

**Current Error Handling:**
```python
try:
    files = await fetch_drive_files(credential.access_token)
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
    if e.response.status_code == 401:
        # Token invalid — attempt refresh
        try:
            new_token = await refresh_google_token(credential.refresh_token)
        except Exception:
            # Refresh failed — notify user to re-authorize
            logger.error(f"Refresh token invalid for user {user_id}")
            # (Currently no user notification — V2 feature)
```

**Workaround:**
- Add monitoring for 401 errors in connector logs
- Send email notification when refresh fails: "Please reconnect your Google account"

**V2 Solution:**
- Proactive token health checks (weekly background job)
- In-app notification when token expires
- Auto-prompt re-authorization on next login

---

### 6. Single OAuth App for All Customers

**Issue:**
All customer deployments share the same Google OAuth app (same `client_id` and `client_secret`).

**Impact:**
- **Shared quota pool:** All customers' API requests count toward same daily quota (10,000 req/day per API)
- **Branding:** Users see "EchoMind" in OAuth consent screen (not customer's company name)
- **Audit trail:** Google Cloud Console logs show all customers' OAuth activity mixed together
- **Security:** If credentials leak, ALL customers' OAuth is compromised

**Workaround:**
- Monitor quota usage carefully
- Request quota increase from Google if needed
- Rotate `client_secret` regularly (every 90 days)

**V2 Solution:**
Customer-managed OAuth apps (V2.3) allow each customer to use their own OAuth app.

## Known Issues

### 7. False Success Toast on 422 Validation Error

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** in V1.1 (2026-02-09)

**Issue (V1.0):**
When connector creation fails with 422 (validation error), frontend still showed "Connector created successfully" toast.

**Root Cause:**
`createConnector()` API function returned `null` on error, but `ConnectorCreateModal.handleSubmit()` didn't check for `null` before showing success toast.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before (V1.0)
const result = await createConnector(localStorage.token, data);
toast.success($i18n.t('Connector created successfully'));  // WRONG

// After (V1.1)
const result = await createConnector(localStorage.token, data);
if (!result) {
  toast.error($i18n.t('Failed to create connector. Please try again.'));
  return;
}
toast.success($i18n.t('Connector created successfully'));  // Correct
```

**Verification:**
- Test: Create Gmail connector without authorizing OAuth first
- Expected: Error toast "Please authorize with Google first using the button above"
- Actual (V1.1): ✅ Correct error shown

---

### 8. Generic Error Messages (Pre-V1.1)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** in V1.1 (2026-02-09)

**Issue (V1.0):**
All OAuth errors showed generic message: "Failed to connect gmail: Error: ..."

**Problems:**
- 501 (OAuth not configured) → Generic "failed" message (user doesn't know to contact admin)
- Popup blocked → Generic "failed" message (user doesn't know to allow popups)
- Timeout → Generic "failed" message

**Fix (V1.1):**
Added specific error messages in `Connectors.svelte`:
- 501: "Google integration is not configured on this server. Please contact your system administrator..."
- Popup blocked: "Popup was blocked by your browser. Please allow popups for this site..."
- Timeout: "Authorization timed out. Please try again."
- 401/403: "Authentication failed. Please sign in again."

**Additionally:** Admin sees console error with setup instructions for 501:
```javascript
console.error(
  '[ADMIN ACTION REQUIRED] Google OAuth not configured. Required environment variables:\n' +
  '  API_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...\n' +
  '  API_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...\n' +
  'Setup guide: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred'
);
```

### 9. Missing OAuth Button in Connector Modal (Pre-V1.1)

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** in V1.1 (2026-02-09)

**Issue (V1.0):**
When user clicked "+ Add Connector" and selected Google service (Drive, Gmail, etc.), modal showed message:
> "Requires Google OAuth. Use the Google Workspace section above to connect first."

**Problems:**
- No OAuth button in modal (user must go back to workspace section)
- Confusing UX (why can't I authorize from here?)
- Unnecessary navigation (workspace → modal → back to workspace → back to modal)

**Fix (V1.1):**
- Added **OAuth button directly in modal** when Google service selected
- Button appears automatically when service requires OAuth and user hasn't authorized
- Three states:
  1. **Not configured (backend):** Red error box "Google Service Not Available" (contact admin)
  2. **Not authorized (user):** Blue box with "Connect to Google" button
  3. **Authorized:** Green checkmark "Connected to Google" + continue with connector creation

**User Flow (V1.1):**
1. Click "+ Add Connector"
2. Select "Gmail"
3. See OAuth button ("Connect to Google")
4. Click button → OAuth popup opens
5. Authorize in popup
6. Popup closes, modal shows "Connected to Google"
7. Fill in connector name
8. Click "Create" → Connector created successfully

## Workarounds

### High OAuth Request Volume

**Problem:** Many users authorizing simultaneously (e.g., company-wide rollout) → risk of hitting rate limits.

**Workaround:**
- **Stagger onboarding:** Roll out to 20 users/day instead of all 100 at once
- **Off-peak hours:** Schedule onboarding during low-traffic hours (e.g., 2am UTC)
- **Increase quota:** Request quota increase from Google ([instructions](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158857))

---

### Shared Drive Access

**Problem:** V1 User Delegation only accesses files user owns or has explicit access to. Cannot access org-wide Shared Drives.

**Workaround:**
- **Grant user access:** Admin adds users to Shared Drive with "Viewer" role
- **Use Service Account (V2):** Wait for V2.1 release with Service Account support

---

### Refresh Token Lost

**Problem:** User changed password → refresh token invalidated → connector stops syncing.

**Workaround:**
- User must manually reconnect Google account (click workspace card → authorize again)
- **Detection:** Check connector status page for "Last sync" timestamp (if > 1 day old, likely token issue)

---

## V2 Improvements

### Planned for V2.1 (Service Account Support)
- ✅ Organization-wide authorization (admin authorizes once for all users)
- ✅ Access to Shared Drives and organizational resources
- ✅ No per-user OAuth friction
- ⚠️ Requires Google Workspace (not personal gmail.com)

### Planned for V2.2 (Monitoring & Throttling)
- ✅ Prometheus metrics for OAuth success rate, API quota usage, errors
- ✅ Grafana dashboard with real-time quota usage visualization
- ✅ Alerts when approaching quota limits (80%, 90%, 95%)
- ✅ Auto-throttling to prevent hitting hard limits

### Planned for V2.3 (Customer-Managed OAuth)
- ✅ Customers can use their own OAuth app (own `client_id`/`client_secret`)
- ✅ Quota isolation (customer's requests don't affect others)
- ✅ Custom branding (company name in OAuth consent screen)
- ✅ Own domain support (e.g., `oauth.customer.com/callback`)
