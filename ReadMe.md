## 🧠 What is it?

EchoMind brings the power of personal AI assistants to the enterprise — **without the security nightmares**.

Like [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/), EchoMind is an AI agent that can access your data, execute workflows, and automate tasks. But instead of running with unrestricted access on personal devices, EchoMind runs in **isolated, ephemeral sandboxes** with enterprise-grade authentication and permission controls.

**EchoMind connects to:**
- **Organizational knowledge** — Teams, SharePoint, Google Drive, internal wikis, policies, and documents
- **Personal business tools** — Email, calendar, CRM, and the apps your teams use daily

> See [63 Supported Connectors](docs/personal-assistant/echomind-connectors.md) — including Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Workday, and more.

**EchoMind is an AI agent** that **thinks** about what the workflow needs, **retrieves** the right internal context, **acts** using tools, then **verifies** the result — all within a secure, permission-aware sandbox.

> Built for real work: support automation, IT deflection, meeting follow-ups, contract review,
> AP/invoice handling, onboarding, and any process where the bottleneck is "finding the right info + doing the next step".

## 🔒 Secure by Design — Sandboxed Execution

Unlike personal AI assistants that run with full system access, EchoMind executes every workflow in an **ephemeral, isolated sandbox**:

| Security Feature | How It Works |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Ephemeral Sandboxes** | Each workflow runs in a fresh container that's destroyed after completion — no state leaks between runs |
| **Delegated Authorization** | Sandboxes call your tools with user-scoped tokens; permissions enforced at every layer |
| **No Direct System Access** | Workflows can't execute arbitrary shell commands on your infrastructure |
| **Lease-Based Execution** | Exclusive access with TTL prevents runaway processes and resource exhaustion |
| **Air-Gap Ready** | Deploy fully disconnected — no internet, no telemetry, no phone-home |

**The result:** Your teams get the productivity of an AI assistant. Your security team sleeps at night.

## ✨ How it works

```
🔄 Think → Act → Observe → Reflect → Evaluate → Answer
```

> The agent 🤔 **thinks** about what information it needs, 👷‍♂️ **acts** by querying sources and tools, 🔍 **observes** the results, and 🤖 **reflects** on whether it has enough context. Before responding, it ⚖️ **evaluates** the quality and completeness of its answer — looping back if needed — then delivers a grounded 💬 **answer**.
## ⚙️ Automation Use Cases (Real-World Inspired)

EchoMind is built for *process automation*, not just Q&A:
**think → act → observe → reflect → evaluate → answer**, with permission-aware answers and source-grounded output.

### 🎧 Customer Support Automation
- Deflect repetitive chats and tickets with grounded answers from your KB and policies
- Escalate only complex cases with full context + suggested replies

### 📝 Meetings → Actions → Follow-ups → CRM
- Generate meeting notes + action items
- Draft follow-up emails
- Save structured notes into your CRM (e.g., Salesforce)

### 🧠 “Knowledge Coach” for Frontline Teams
- Make staff dramatically faster at finding the right internal info
- Serve answers grounded in policies, research, and product docs

### 🧰 IT Helpdesk Ticket Deflection (Shift-Left)
- Resolve common issues without creating tickets
- Pre-fill tickets only when needed (device, logs, steps tried)

### ⚖️ Contract Review Acceleration
- Extract key terms, flag risky clauses, summarize obligations
- Suggest redlines based on your playbooks and templates

### 🧾 Accounts Payable Automation
- Invoice extraction + coding suggestions
- Approval routing + audit-ready explanations

## OpenClaw vs EchoMind

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) is an open-source personal AI assistant that runs locally with full system access — shell commands, file operations, browser control. It's powerful for individuals, but [security researchers have flagged serious concerns](https://blogs.cisco.com/ai/personal-ai-agents-like-openclaw-are-a-security-nightmare) for organizational use: credential exposure, malicious skill injection, and no secure-by-default setup.

**EchoMind is OpenClaw for business** — the same AI agent capabilities, redesigned for enterprise security:

| Capability | OpenClaw | EchoMind |
|------------|----------|----------|
| AI-powered workflows | Personal device | Isolated sandbox |
| System access | Unrestricted shell/files | Permission-controlled APIs |
| Data sources | Local files, messaging apps | Org knowledge + business tools |
| Security model | User responsibility | Enterprise-grade (OIDC, LDAP, air-gap) |
| Execution environment | Persistent on device | Ephemeral containers |
| Target use case | Personal productivity | Team/org automation |
| Cost | Free + API costs | Free (MIT) + API costs |

**Bottom line:** If you want an AI assistant for personal use, OpenClaw is excellent. If you want to deploy AI assistants across your organization without creating security vulnerabilities, EchoMind is built for that.

---

## Observability & Visualization

EchoMind includes a full observability stack covering infrastructure metrics, log aggregation, Gen AI evaluation, and vector visualization. All observability features are **optional** and gated by environment flags.

---

### Vector Visualization with TensorBoard

The **Projector Service** generates interactive 3D/2D visualizations of your vector collections using [TensorBoard Projector](https://projector.tensorflow.org/).

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Collection Scoping** | Visualize vectors scoped to user (`user_{id}`), team (`team_{id}`), or organization (`org_{id}`) |
| **Search Filtering** | Optionally filter vectors by full-text search on title and content |
| **On-Demand Generation** | Trigger via API (`POST /api/v1/projector/generate`) or WebUI |
| **Batch Processing** | Fetches up to 20,000 vectors from Qdrant in batches of 500 |

**How it works:**
1. API receives a generation request with collection scope and optional search query
2. Request is published to NATS (`projector.generate`)
3. Projector worker fetches vectors from Qdrant, generates TensorFlow checkpoints + metadata
4. TensorBoard serves the visualization at `https://tensorboard.<DOMAIN>`

**Configuration:** `TENSORBOARD_DOMAIN`, `PROJECTOR_QDRANT_URL`, `PROJECTOR_LOG_DIR`

> See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for service interaction diagrams.

---

### Gen AI Observability with RAGAS and Langfuse

[Langfuse v3](https://langfuse.com/) provides **LLM observability** and [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/) provides **RAG quality evaluation** — giving you visibility into how well your AI is performing.

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Langfuse Traces** | Records every chat interaction: query, response, context chunks, latency |
| **RAGAS Faithfulness** | Is the response grounded in the retrieved context? (0-1 score) |
| **RAGAS Response Relevancy** | Is the response relevant to the user's query? (0-1 score) |
| **RAGAS Context Precision** | Are the retrieved chunks relevant to the query? (0-1 score) |

**Two evaluation modes:**
- **Online (sampled)**: Configurable fraction of chat requests auto-evaluated (`RAGAS_SAMPLE_RATE`, default 10%)
- **Batch**: Admin-triggered evaluation of recent sessions via WebUI or API (`POST /api/v1/evaluate/batch`)

**Enabling:** Set `ENABLE_LANGFUSE=true` in `.env.host` and configure secrets. See [Langfuse Setup](docs/langfuse-setup.md).

Langfuse shares PostgreSQL, MinIO, and Redis with EchoMind. ClickHouse is dedicated to Langfuse for OLAP trace storage.

---

### Standard Observability with Grafana, Loki, Prometheus

The infrastructure observability stack provides metrics, logs, and dashboards — all self-hosted with no external dependencies.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| [**Prometheus**](https://prometheus.io/) | Metrics collection — scrapes `/metrics` from all services every 10s |
| [**Loki**](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | Log aggregation — collects container stdout via Alloy |
| [**Grafana**](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) | Dashboards — 12 pre-shipped dashboards, Authentik SSO |
| [**Alloy**](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/) | Log collector — auto-discovers Docker containers |
| **Exporters** | cAdvisor (containers), node-exporter (host), postgres-exporter, nats-exporter |

**12 Pre-Shipped Grafana Dashboards:**

| Dashboard | What It Shows |
|-----------|---------------|
| EchoMind Overview | Service health, error rates, NATS queue depth |
| Loki Logs Explorer | Service log browser with level filtering and full-text search |
| RAGAS Evaluation | RAG quality score trends, distributions, evaluation rates |
| Docker Containers | Per-container CPU, memory, network I/O, restarts |
| Node Exporter | Host CPU, memory, disk, network interfaces |
| NATS Server | Connections, messages in/out, throughput |
| NATS JetStream | Stream/consumer message counts, pending, lag |
| Traefik | HTTP request rate, latency percentiles, error rates |
| PostgreSQL | Connections, transactions, locks, cache hit ratio |
| MinIO | Object storage capacity, S3 traffic, request latency |
| Qdrant | Vector DB collection stats, query performance |
| Loki (self-monitoring) | Ingestion rate, error rates |

**Enabling:** Set `ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY=true` in `.env.host`. Access Grafana at `https://grafana.<DOMAIN>`.

> OpenTelemetry compatibility: The stack uses Prometheus exposition format and Loki's log pipeline, both of which are OpenTelemetry-compatible. Services can be instrumented with OTel SDKs to push traces and metrics alongside the pull-based Prometheus scraping.
