## 🧠 What is it?

EchoMind is an **agentic RAG platform** that actually *thinks* before it retrieves.

```
🔄 Think → Act → Observe → Reflect → Evaluate → Answer
```

> The agent 🤔 **thinks** about what information it needs, 🎯 **acts** by querying sources and tools, 🔍 **observes** the results, and 🤖 **reflects** on whether it has enough context. Before responding, it ⚖️ **evaluates** the quality and completeness of its answer — looping back if needed — then delivers a grounded 💬 **answer**.

|                                   |                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 **Multi-Step Retrieval**       | Goes beyond "retrieve-then-generate" — reasons across multiple sources      |
| 🏠 **Private and SaaS LLM Ready** | Run with TGI/vLLM on your own GPU cluster or connected to your favorite LLM API |
| 🔒 **Air-Gap / SCIF Ready**       | No internet, no telemetry, no phone-home — fully self-contained             |
| 📦 **Deploy Anywhere**            | Single container to Kubernetes cluster — your choice                        |
| ⚖️ **MIT Licensed**               | Free and open source, forever                                               |

## What is EchoMind?

EchoMind is an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** platform that goes beyond traditional retrieve-then-generate patterns. Unlike conventional RAG systems that simply fetch and paste context, EchoMind's agent:

- **Reasons** about what information it needs before retrieving
- **Plans** multi-step retrieval strategies across multiple data sources
- **Uses tools** to execute actions, call APIs, and process data
- **Remembers** context across conversations with short-term and long-term memory

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agentic Architecture** | Think → Act → Observe → Reflect loop for intelligent retrieval |
| **Multi-Source Connectors** | Microsoft Teams, Google Drive (v1), with more planned |
| **Flexible Deployment** | Cloud, Hybrid, or fully Air-Gapped (SCIF compliant) |
| **Private LLM Inference** | TGI/vLLM for on-premise GPU clusters |
| **Enterprise Auth** | Authentik with OIDC/LDAP/Active Directory support |
| **Per-User Vector Collections** | Scoped search across user, group, and organization data |

## Deployment Modes

EchoMind adapts to your security requirements:

| Mode | Description                                              | Use Case |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Cloud** | Deploy on your Could | Startups, teams without GPU infrastructure |
| **Hybrid** | Private RAG cluster + optional cloud LLM fallback        | Enterprises with sensitive data |
| **Air-Gapped** | Fully disconnected, zero external dependencies           | DoD, SCIF, classified networks |

### Air-Gapped / SCIF Compliance

EchoMind is designed for the most restricted environments:

- No internet access required
- No telemetry or phone-home capabilities
- All dependencies pre-packaged in container images
- Deployable to [Iron Bank (Platform One)](https://p1.dso.mil/iron-bank)
- LDAP/Active Directory integration via Authentik
